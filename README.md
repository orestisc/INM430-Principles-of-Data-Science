In this paper we look at a mental health survey conducted for the tech industry and try to analyse and find patterns thatcharacterise participants behaviour with the workplace environment and their mental condition. We then move to identify some correlation between features such as remote working and comfort of discussing mental health issues with their company. Furthermore, we analyse comment words to identify a motive. Finally, we attempt to find whether we can predict a mental health condition based on the participants responses.
